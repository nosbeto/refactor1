## Guide
Clone the repo and try to make the website more efficient by:
- Make it more accessible to everyone
- Try to reduce the CSS code as much as possible to avoid bad developer practices
- Include comments to pass over the code (BoyScout rule)


## Topics

During this practice I reinforced the following:
- Comments are a very useful to understand code which wasn't created by you
- It is a good practice to mantain any code as clean as possible
- Standardizing colors might lead to a better user experience
